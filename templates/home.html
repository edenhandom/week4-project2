                    Ever wondered what your music taste says about you? At Mood Mix, we believe that the 
                    songs you love are more than just tunes â€“ they're a reflection of who you are.

                    Research shows that our personalities are closely linked to our musical preferences. 
                    Extroverts often feel the beat with upbeat, rhythmic music, while those with interoverted 
                    personality might lean towards improvisational and instrumental tracks. 
                    Your favorite genres can reveal aspects of your age, social class, income, 
                    cultural background, and even self-esteem.
